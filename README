Hello and welcome to my GitHub project RBA_MC_Sim.
My name is Matthias Oliver Stein is this is a part of my current research/ Ph.D-Thesis at the TU Braunschweig.

The project is about the measurement uncertainty of ligand binding assays.
Here, in particular, I investigate the effect of specific factors, like the design space or the experimental design,
on the measurement uncertainty by a monte carlo studie. The overall goal is to find setups the minimize the error.

All related python scripts, most of the figures and additional informations will be uploaded here

For details send me an E-mail: matthias.stein@tu-braunschweig.de
